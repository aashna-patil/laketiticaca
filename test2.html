    <h1>Lake Titicaca</h1>

    <h3>Lake Titicaca is located in the Andes Mountain Range 
       located in South America. Situated between Peru to the 
       left and Bolivia to the right, it is located 3,810 m 
       above sea level and is thought to be millions of years
       old.</h3>

       <h2>History</h2>

       <h3>The lake was formed when massive earthquakes shook the 
          Andes Mountains splitting the range in two and forming 
          a hollow that eventually got filled with water from the
          melting glaciers, creating bodies of water and ultimately
          rivers and the immense Lake Titicaca. Lake Titicaca was the
          cradle for Peru’s ancient civilizations. The Puraka culture
          settled in this fertile land around 200BC and a millennium
          later the Tiwuanaku culture emerged and spread throughout
          the Altiplano and into Bolivia. Warlike tribes like the
          Aymaras and the Collas emerged only to be absorbed by 
          the Incas. It was the Inca civilization that unified the
          many cultures and spread into this land forming the 
          Inca Empire.</h3>

       <h2>Wildlife</h2>

       <h3>The wildlife of Lake Titicaca are some of the hardiest, 
          most resilient species you’ll come across on your trip 
          to Peru or holiday in Bolivia. As you can imagine, living
          in the thin air of 12,500 ft. (3,810 m.) above sea level
          isn’t for the faint of heart. For example, Titicaca Grebe
          is an endemic species to Lake Titicaca. It can be found
          in the shallow waters of the lake’s Totora reed edges. 
          The Titicaca Grebe is a flightless water bird with an 
          easily recognizable reddish plume on the back of its head,
          meaning you have all of the information you need to know
          where and how to search for this native species on your
          Lake Titicaca tour.</h3>

       <h2>Climatic conditions</h2>

       <h3>Lake Titicaca has a borderline subtropical highland/alpine
           climate with cool to cold temperatures for most of the 
           year.Scientists say that one of the only sources of pollution
           is domestic and industrial waste from the nearby cities of 
           La Paz and El Alto-in rivers that drain into the lake.</h3>
